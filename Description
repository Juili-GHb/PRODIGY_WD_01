The task is to create an interactive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The menu should have a fixed position, remain visible on all pages, and change style (such as background or font color)
when scrolled or when hovering over menu items. HTML will structure the menu, CSS will style it, and
JavaScript will add the interactivity.This is Task-01 under the "ProDigy Infotech" initiative
